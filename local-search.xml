    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today is the second day of my quarantine session. Due to the unespected situation and my original career path, I decided to accelerate my job hunting. But when I begin, I am a little comfused and upset. I understand I need sometime to digest a new way of thinking. I might be immature and naive. I almost spent the whole day in looking for information and filling up different files. </p><p>To summarise some points that I obtained today, I need to firm my essential coding skills. I did not learn programming until last year, but it cannot be my excuse. Also, I need to find out how I can use what I know to make profit. This year, I learned about Computer Vision, Graphics, VR/AR. I enjoyed learning new stuff but worried little about what I can do with these cutting-edge technologies. Also, I need to link these back to the fundamental data sturctures and popular libraries. </p><p>Hope today’s work can help me make my mind!</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today is 2020/04/15. I have arrived in Shanghai and begun my quarantine life. As I have two upcoming deadlines, I will dedicate my time on two topics during the quarantine period. One is <strong>volumetric transform</strong>, the other is <strong>using asymmetric vibration to induce sensation of force</strong>. Because of UCL school policy, I am not allowed to show my coursework in detail. I will only show briefly the literature review and my understandings of the second topics. Later, I will probably show you the results of the first topics. Also, I will make a series of topics in <strong>Computer Vision</strong> when I do my revision during and after the quarantine period.</p><p>One thing I found intriguing in the area of VR was haptics. Nowadays, there are many ways to use human hands to interact with virtual objects. They are easier and more intuitive than the normal VR controllers. The cheapest way is the hand tracking using cameras. For example, Oculus has announced that they will include hand tracking in the latest Oculus Quest; Leap Motion has worked in this field for a decade. Despite, using visual information is cheap, it is not always reliable as the hand position, orientation, light and occlusion conditions are constantly varying. Haptics glove is one alternative. Data-driven gloves can precisely track our hand and fingers. Plus, with the available data, force feedback haptics can be built.</p><p>Personally, I believed that force feedback haptic glove is the future of VR interaction. Users cannot only touch, hold and move virtual objects, but also feel the shape, reaction force, texture or even temperature of the virtual objects. Is not a fascinating idea?</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today is 2020/04/13, I will be on the plane to China in about 10 hours. I heard about how writing blog would help improve IT skills for a long time, but did not know when and how to start. Now I finally made my mind to create a blog. For thhe processes, I conducted “<a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Yb411a7ty?from=search&amp;seid=13126380643235482353&quot;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Yb411a7ty?from=search&amp;seid=13126380643235482353&quot;</a>. CodeSheep gave a great and detailed introduction to the Hexo blog framework. As I succeed, I decided to write it down which may make your creation easier and faster.</p><p>I used MacOs, so if you encounter any difficulies, google it.</p><p>This article is served as a record for myself. All the credits should be given to CodeSheep. (<a href="https://www.codesheep.cn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.codesheep.cn/</a>)</p><h2 id="Step-1-Download-Dependencies"><a href="#Step-1-Download-Dependencies" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Download Dependencies"></a>Step 1: Download Dependencies</h2><p>nodejs: <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://nodejs.org/en/</a><br>git: <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://git-scm.com/downloads</a></p><p>Open Terminal and switch to root user</p><pre><code>sudo su</code></pre><p>put your password in.</p><p>Use</p><pre><code>node -vnpm -vgit -v</code></pre><p>to confirm you successfully download node.js and Git.</p><h2 id="Addition-Step"><a href="#Addition-Step" class="headerlink" title="Addition Step"></a>Addition Step</h2><p>If you are in China, ‘cnpm’ should be faster than ‘npm’.</p><p>Install cnpm and registry to TaoBao.</p><pre><code>npm install -g cnpm --registry=https://registry.npm.taobao.org</code></pre><p>Then, in the following context, replace ‘npm’ with ‘cnpm’</p><hr><h2 id="Step-2-Download-Hexo-Framework"><a href="#Step-2-Download-Hexo-Framework" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Download Hexo Framework"></a>Step 2: Download Hexo Framework</h2><pre><code>npm install -g hexo-cli</code></pre><p>After dowaload, you can use</p><pre><code>hexo -v</code></pre><p>to confirm.</p><hr><h2 id="Step-3-Create-a-blog"><a href="#Step-3-Create-a-blog" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Create a blog"></a>Step 3: Create a blog</h2><p>Use</p><pre><code>mkdir blog</code></pre><p>to create a directory for you to write your blog.</p><p>In that directory, use</p><pre><code>sudo hexo init</code></pre><p>to create the blog.</p><p>Congratulations! Your blog has been created. Then you can use</p><pre><code>hexo s</code></pre><p>to start running the hexo server. By default, you should be able to access your blog locally with “<a href="http://localhost:4000/&quot;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://localhost:4000/&quot;</a></p><p>Basic hexo instructions can be found in your blog when you first create it. Here are some.</p><pre><code>hexo n &quot;PUT THE NAME OF YOUR POST HERE&quot;  # to creat a new posthexo clean  # to clean the bloghexo g  # to generate the blog with your posthexo s  # to run your blog locallyhexo d  # to deploy your blog</code></pre><p>The blog posts will be in MarkDown format.</p><hr><h2 id="Step-4-Deploy-your-Blog"><a href="#Step-4-Deploy-your-Blog" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Deploy your Blog"></a>Step 4: Deploy your Blog</h2><p>To run your blog remotely, you have to deploy your blog. Here, we will deploy it on your github.</p><p>Create a new repository on Github. The Repository name has to be “YourID.github.io”!!</p><p>Use</p><pre><code>npm install --save hexo-deployer-git</code></pre><p>to download a plugin needed.</p><p>After download, modify “_config.yml” file, “Deployment” section to</p><pre><code>deploy:  type: git  repo: https://github.com/YourID/YourID.github.io.git  branch: master  # set the default branch.</code></pre><p>The ‘branch’ is not necessary unless you want to use an alternative branch of your git project.</p><p>Use the instuction</p><pre><code>hexo d</code></pre><p>to deploy the blog.</p><p>It may ask you to fill in your github ID and password. Then use “<a href="https://YourID.github.io&quot;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://YourID.github.io&quot;</a>, you should be able to access your blog remotely.</p><hr><h2 id="Step-5-Change-the-Theme"><a href="#Step-5-Change-the-Theme" class="headerlink" title="Step 5: Change the Theme"></a>Step 5: Change the Theme</h2><p>First, you can find a hexo theme that you like, just google it.</p><p>Here I will use mine as an example. I used hexo-theme-fluid. More details are in the github “<a href="https://github.com/fluid-dev/hexo-theme-fluid&quot;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/fluid-dev/hexo-theme-fluid&quot;</a>.</p><p>To use the theme, you should first download it or simply use</p><pre><code>&quot;&quot;&quot;Change the link to your selected one, and the &#39;fluid&#39; to the name you like.Better to use the theme name&quot;&quot;&quot;git clone https://github.com/fluid-dev/hexo-theme-fluid themes/fluid</code></pre><p>modify “_config.yml”, “Extensions” section. Change the theme name to your file name. In my case, it was</p><pre><code>theme: fluid</code></pre><p>Clean, generate and deploy it again. Then, the blog becomes the way you see now.</p><p>That is all. I am glad if you also manage to create one. Later, I will put more stuff on this website. May be my studies, my interests or even diaries. Hopefully, they will be helpful for you.</p><p><em>Thank you! Wish you a great day!</em></p>]]></content>
